In Fall 2023, I worked for Dr. Roberto Guglielmi from the Applied Mathematics
Department at the University of Waterloo as a Research Assistant. We worked on
the controllability of partial differential equations. Our goal was proving the
controllability of the one-dimensional Fokker-Plank equation, which we were able to
do for some restricted cases.
 
In Spring 2024, I joined the IQC as a recipient of the Undergraduate Research Award.  
Additionally, I was one of 30 students worldwide accepted into the USEQIP Program.
As previously mentioned, I worked with Dr. Joseph Emerson. I wrote the solutions for
Dr. Emerson’s open quantum system book, collaborated with his graduate students,
wrote a 50-page project on “Superoperator Representations and Characterization of
Completely Positive Maps” and soon will run simulations using true-Q, a quantum
characterization and validation platform, to conduct a series of experiments aimed
at benchmarking quantum hardware performance.
 
I will continue working with Dr. Emerson during Fall 2024 and Winter 2025 as part of
the course PHYS 437A/B: Research Project, where I will be under his supervision.
