Welcome to my personal website! I am Danesh Morales Hashemi, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics in Mathematical Physics and a minor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. In Spring 2025, I will start my Masters of Applied Mathematics specialized in Quantum Information at the University of Waterloo, with Dr. Joseph Emerson as my supervisor.

### About Me


<!-- ### Teaching Experience

Teaching and and helping students  As a General Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Faculty of Engineering and an Instructional Support Assistant for the Faculty of Mathematics, I have facilitated tutorials and help sessions for over 1200 first-year students, developed grading scripts to enhance academic integrity, and collaborated with other teaching assistants to ensure a consistent and fair learning environment. -->

<!-- ### Academic Background

My coursework includes a wide array of subjects that form the backbone of my expertise: Calculus, Computational Mathematics, Quantum Theory, Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, and more. These courses have equipped me with the analytical skills and theoretical knowledge necessary to tackle complex problems in both quantum information and mathematical physics. -->

### Awards and Honors

I am grateful to have been recognized for my academic and research endeavors with several awards, including the Institute for Quantum Computing Undergraduate Research Award, the University of Waterloo Presidentâ€™s Scholarship, and the Full Undergraduate Educational Excellence Scholarship from the National Secretary of Science and Technology of Panama, which gave me the opportunity to come to Canada.
