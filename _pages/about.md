Welcome to my personal website! I am Danesh Morales Hashemi, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics in Mathematical Physics and a minor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. In Spring 2025, I will start my Masters of Applied Mathematics specialized in Quantum Information at the University of Waterloo, with Dr. Joseph Emerson as my supervisor.

### Research Experience

In Fall 2023, I worked for Dr. Roberto Guglielmi from the Applied Mathematics
Department at the University of Waterloo as a Research Assistant. We worked on
the controllability of partial differential equations. Our goal was proving the
controllability of the one-dimensional Fokker-Plank equation, which we were able to
do for some restricted cases.
 
In Spring 2024, I joined the IQC as a recipient of the Undergraduate Research Award.
Additionally, I was one of 30 students worldwide accepted into the USEQIP Program.
As previously mentioned, I worked with Dr. Joseph Emerson. I wrote the solutions for
Dr. Emerson’s open quantum system book, collaborated with his graduate students,
wrote a 50-page project on “Superoperator Representations and Characterization of
Completely Positive Maps” and soon will run simulations using true-Q, a quantum
characterization and validation platform, to conduct a series of experiments aimed
at benchmarking quantum hardware performance.
 
I will continue working with Dr. Emerson during Fall 2024 and Winter 2025 as part of
the course PHYS 437A/B: Research Project, where I will be under his supervision.

<!-- ### Teaching Experience

Teaching and and helping students  As a General Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Faculty of Engineering and an Instructional Support Assistant for the Faculty of Mathematics, I have facilitated tutorials and help sessions for over 1200 first-year students, developed grading scripts to enhance academic integrity, and collaborated with other teaching assistants to ensure a consistent and fair learning environment. -->

<!-- ### Academic Background

My coursework includes a wide array of subjects that form the backbone of my expertise: Calculus, Computational Mathematics, Quantum Theory, Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, and more. These courses have equipped me with the analytical skills and theoretical knowledge necessary to tackle complex problems in both quantum information and mathematical physics. -->

### Awards and Honors

I am grateful to have been recognized for my academic and research endeavors with several awards, including the Institute for Quantum Computing Undergraduate Research Award, the University of Waterloo President’s Scholarship, and the Full Undergraduate Educational Excellence Scholarship from the National Secretary of Science and Technology of Panama, which gave me the opportunity to come to Canada.
